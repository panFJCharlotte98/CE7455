This task will be performed on the [TREC question dataset](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/Data/QA/QC/), a collection of questions designed to be classified into a small set of categories.\n","\n","In this initial notebook, we aim to grasp the fundamental concepts without a primary focus on achieving high accuracy. Subsequent notebooks will expand upon this foundation to improve the model's performance.\n","\n","### Introduction\n","\n","For analyzing sequences such as sentences in questions, we'll utilize a **recurrent neural network** (RNN). RNNs are particularly suited for sequence analysis, as they process sequences of words, $X=\\{x_1, ..., x_T\\}$, one at a time. Each word in the sequence is associated with a _hidden state_, $h$, which is updated sequentially. The RNN operates _recurrently_ by taking in the current word $x_t$ and the hidden state from the preceding word, $h_{t-1}$, to generate the next hidden state, $h_t$.\n","\n","$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n","\n","Upon processing the last word in the question, $x_T$, and obtaining the final hidden state, $h_T$, this state is passed through a linear layer, $f$, to predict the question's category, $\\hat{y} = f(h_T)$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q7PlOzNmH1tP"},"source":["## Preparing Data\n","\n","For processing textual data in PyTorch, TorchText provides a powerful abstraction through the concept of `Field`. These define how to process your data, which, in the context of the TREC question classification task, includes the raw text of the question and its category label.\n","\n","### Fields Definition\n","\n","To process the questions and their labels, we define two fields: `TEXT` for the questions and `LABEL` for the categories.\n","\n","- The `TEXT` field specifies how the questions should be processed. We employ `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument to use the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer, which is more sophisticated than simple space-based tokenization. This requires specifying `tokenizer_language` to indicate the spaCy model to use, typically `en_core_web_sm` for English text. This model must be downloaded prior to running your notebook using the command: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.\n","\n","- The `LABEL` field is managed by a `LabelField`, a variant of the `Field` designed for handling categorical data. The `dtype` argument will be clarified subsequently, ensuring the labels are processed appropriately for classification.\n","\n","For a deeper dive into `Fields` and their configuration, refer to [this Documentation](https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#field).\n","\n","### Random Seed for Reproducibility\n","\n","To ensure that our experiments can be replicated, we set the random seed at the beginning of our preprocessing script. This controls the randomness involved in splitting the dataset and initializing the model weights, making our results reproducible.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"hVuNibrCUAdf"},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import numpy as np\n","import random\n","\n","SEED =
